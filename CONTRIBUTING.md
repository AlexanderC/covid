## Contributing

1. If you have any questions about the application, please use the Github issues.

2. If you find a security bug, **DO NOT** submit an issue here.
Please send an e-mail to [Etienne Depaulis](mailto:etienne.depaulis@lifen.fr)
instead.

3. Do a small search on the issues tracker before submitting your issue to
see if it was already reported or fixed. In case it was not, create your report. If you are getting exceptions, please include the full backtrace.

4. Feel free to add a localization if needed. Our "I18n" coverage is not perfect (~30% of specific labels/messages are still in French), we will provide support if need be ;)

That's it! The more information you give, the more easy it becomes for us to
track it down and fix it. Ideal scenario would be adding the issue to our
test suite or to a sample application.

Thanks!
